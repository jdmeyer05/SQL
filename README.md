SQL Code

Here are several reasonably basic examples of SQL code I have either written or extensively modified to meet the needs of the Net Volume Analysis workbook mentioned in my VBA section

I also have, for a project in my Masters's program, designed, built, deployed, and tested my database.

I am looking forward to learning more about SQL and mastering this language.
