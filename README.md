SQL Code

Here are several fairly basic example of SQL code I have either written or greatly modifided to meet the needs of the Net Volume Analysis workbook mentined in my VBA section

I have also for a project in my Masters program designed, built, deployed and tested my own database.

I am looking forward to learning more about SQL and mastering this language.
